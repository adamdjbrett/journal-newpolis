    THE HERETIC AND THE ICONOCLAST: SYLVIA WYNTER'S ENGAGEMENT WITH DERRIDA
description: "In an interview between Jacques Derrida, Jean-Louis Houdebine, and Guy Scarpetta entitled “Positions”, Derrida speaks of the “general strategy of deconstruction”, wherein the focus is to “avoid both simply neutralizing the binary oppositions of metaphysics and simply residing within the closed field of these oppositions, thereby confirming it”. He is speaking against a common misunderstanding of the project of deconstruction as mere “reversal” – the substitution of the prime (privileged term) for the subprime term (the underprivileged term). Instead, Derrida insists upon the need for a subsequent phase, “we must traverse a phase of overturning”. “The necessity of the phase is structural” and is one that recognizes the violence of the history of Western metaphysics. Derrida says, “to do justice to this necessity is to recognize that in classical philosophical oppositions we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-a-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy”."
