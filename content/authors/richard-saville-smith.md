bio: "I specialise in the intersection of madness, psychiatry and religious experience from a philosophical perspective. In Acute Religious Experiences: Madness, Psychosis and Religious Studies (published by Bloomsbury on March 9th 2023) I set out two discourses on extraordinary/anomalous/extreme states of consciousness: the pathologizing discourse of psychiatry in the DSM series and the non-pathological discourse of 20th century humanities' scholars. By critically re-reading this fractured discourse (William James's pathological programme, Rudolf Otto's numinous, T K Oesterreich's possession, Mircea Eliade's shamanism, Walter Stace's mysticism, Walter Pahnke's psychedelic experience and Abraham Maslow's peak experiences) I identify the need for language with which to address non-pathological experiences of the extraordinary/anomalous/extreme which are constructed as religious but sufficiently extreme to be of interest to psychiatry - I propose Acute Religious Experiences."
