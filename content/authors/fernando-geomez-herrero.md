name: "Fernando Gómez Herrero"
organization: "Birkbeck College, London"
bio: "I am interested in exploring the (im-)possible meanings of “history” (or the “past”) embedded in contemporary societies, working on the fundamental assumption that we are no clean slates and have therefore not yet fully become post-historical creatures. I thus look into historical reason. I am also equally interested in the political dimension, the “us versus them” of social relations, its old, current and new forms, particularly utopian. I thus also look into political reason."
