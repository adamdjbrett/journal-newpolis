name: Brendan John Brown
organization: New School for Social Research
bio: "I am a Ph.D. student at The Centre for the Study of Theory and Criticism in the University of Western Ontario. I am primarily interested in analyzing the racial fault lines in Western philosophy and metaphysics through a critique of the history of philosophy with a special focus on deconstruction, colonial historiography, and the Black Radical tradition. I am currently completing my dissertation on an “archeology of speed,” which analyzes the philosophical phenomena of fugitivity and messianism. I have written on Walter Benjamin, Sylvia Wynter, the Foucault–Derrida debate, Nietzsche, and alternative strategies of deconstruction. My work has appeared or will appear in the *CLR James Journal*, *Angelaki*, *Labyrinth*, and *The Journal of Speculative Philosophy*."
